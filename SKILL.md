# Five Ways Analysis

## Purpose

Systematically demonstrate arguments for God's existence through five distinct rational proofs examining features of the natural world. Each argument begins from observable phenomena and concludes to the existence of a being with divine attributes.


## When to Use

- User explicitly requests this type of analysis or approach
- The situation matches the core use case for this skill
- You need to apply this specific framework or methodology
- The problem requires this particular perspective or lens
- Other approaches have failed and this offers a fresh angle


## When to Invoke

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Does God exist?"
- "Prove God's existence"
- "Arguments for theism"
- "Why believe in God?"
- "Natural theology arguments"
- "Cosmological arguments"
- "Is there evidence for God?"
- "Rational basis for belief in God"

**Contexts:**
- Philosophy of religion discussions
- Apologetics conversations
- Natural theology inquiries
- Debates about theism vs. atheism
- Metaphysical investigations about first causes

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Question | The specific question about God's existence | Yes |
| Context | Philosophical background of the questioner | No |
| Objections | Known objections to address | No |
| Focus | Specific Way to emphasize (1-5) | No |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Argument presentation | Clear statement of premises and conclusions |
| Analysis | Examination of each Way's logical structure |
| Response to objections | Addressing common counterarguments |
| Cumulative case | How the Five Ways work together |

## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```


## Workflow
### Step 1: Identify the Starting Point

Each Way begins from an observable feature of the world:
1. **Motion** - Things are in motion (change from potency to act)
2. **Efficient Causation** - Things are caused by other things
3. **Contingency** - Things exist but need not exist
4. **Gradation** - Things exhibit degrees of perfection
5. **Teleology** - Things act for ends (final causality)

### Step 2: Apply the Principle of Sufficient Reason

For each Way, show that the observed phenomenon requires explanation:
- Motion requires a mover
- Effects require causes
- Contingent beings require a reason for existence
- Degrees require a maximum
- Order toward ends requires an orderer

### Step 3: Demonstrate the Impossibility of Infinite Regress

Show why an infinite series of dependent causes cannot explain the phenomenon:
- In an essentially ordered series (per se), each member depends on a prior for its current causing
- Remove the first, and the whole series collapses
- There must be a first uncaused cause

### Step 4: Conclude to a First Cause with Divine Attributes

Identify what this first cause must be:
- **First Way**: Unmoved Mover (pure act, no potency)
- **Second Way**: Uncaused Cause (self-existent)
- **Third Way**: Necessary Being (cannot not exist)
- **Fourth Way**: Maximum Being (perfect in all perfections)
- **Fifth Way**: Intelligent Orderer (mind directing nature)

### Step 5: Connect to Traditional Divine Attributes

Show how the Five Ways converge on the same being:
- Pure Act implies immutability, eternity, simplicity
- Necessary Being implies independence, self-existence
- Maximum Being implies perfection, goodness, unity
- These attributes identify "what all people call God"

## The Five Ways in Detail

### First Way: Argument from Motion

**Premises:**
1. Some things are in motion (changing from potency to act)
2. Whatever is in motion is moved by another (nothing can be in potency and act in the same respect)
3. This cannot go on to infinity (in essentially ordered series)
4. Therefore, there is a First Unmoved Mover

**Key distinction:** This concerns sustaining causation NOW, not temporal beginning

### Second Way: Argument from Efficient Causation

**Premises:**
1. Some things are caused to exist by other things
2. Nothing can be the efficient cause of itself (would have to exist before itself)
3. This cannot go on to infinity (same reason as First Way)
4. Therefore, there is a First Uncaused Cause

### Third Way: Argument from Contingency

**Premises:**
1. Some things exist but need not exist (contingent beings)
2. If everything were contingent, there would have been a time when nothing existed
3. If nothing existed, nothing could begin to exist
4. But things exist now
5. Therefore, there is a Necessary Being

### Fourth Way: Argument from Gradation

**Premises:**
1. Things exhibit degrees of perfection (more or less good, true, noble)
2. Degrees presuppose a maximum (more or less implies comparison to a standard)
3. What is maximally such is the cause of all others of that kind
4. Therefore, there is a Maximum Being, cause of all being and goodness

### Fifth Way: Argument from Design (Teleological)

**Premises:**
1. Natural things act for ends regularly (not by chance)
2. Things lacking knowledge cannot act for ends unless directed by intelligence
3. Therefore, some intelligent being directs all natural things to their ends

## Example Application

**User question:** "Can reason prove God exists, or is it just faith?"

**Analysis using Five Ways:**

This question triggers both the Five Ways and the faith-reason synthesis. I would:

1. **Clarify the question**: Distinguish proving God's existence (possible by reason) from knowing God's inner nature (requires revelation)

2. **Present the Third Way** (often most accessible):
   - "Look at anything that exists - this cup, this tree, yourself"
   - "Notice that it COULD not exist - there was a time before it, there could be a time after"
   - "Now ask: why does it exist rather than not exist?"
   - "The answer cannot be another contingent thing, because that just pushes the question back"
   - "There must be something that CANNOT not exist - a Necessary Being"

3. **Address the objection** "But why can't the universe itself be necessary?":
   - The universe is composed of contingent things
   - A collection of contingent things is itself contingent
   - Therefore the universe requires an external ground

4. **Conclude**: "Reason CAN demonstrate that God exists. What reason cannot demonstrate - God's Trinity, the Incarnation - belongs to faith. But faith builds on reason; it does not replace it."

## Common Objections and Responses

### "Who made God?"
This misunderstands the argument. God is not a being among beings requiring a cause. God is the Uncaused Cause, the Necessary Being - that which cannot not exist and is the ground of all else.

### "Why can't there be an infinite regress?"
In an essentially ordered series (where each member depends on a prior for its current causation), removing the first removes all. An infinite chain of causally dependent links, with no first link, explains nothing.

### "The Big Bang explains the universe"
The Five Ways do not depend on temporal beginning. They argue for a sustaining cause NOW. Even if the universe had no temporal beginning, it would still require a ground for its contingent existence.

### "Evolution explains design without a designer"
The Fifth Way concerns the fundamental orderedness of nature that makes evolution possible. Why do natural things follow regular patterns at all? This order requires explanation.

## Integration Notes

**Parent Expert:** thomas-aquinas

**Related Skills:**
- **faith-reason-synthesis**: The Five Ways demonstrate what reason can achieve (preambles of faith)
- **analogical-reasoning**: Helps explain how we can meaningfully speak of God as "Unmoved Mover"
- **scholastic-method**: The Five Ways exemplify scholastic argumentation

**Skill Interaction:**
When users ask about God's existence, the Five Ways provide the rational demonstration. When they ask how faith and reason relate, invoke faith-reason-synthesis to show how the Five Ways represent reason's contribution to theological knowledge.
